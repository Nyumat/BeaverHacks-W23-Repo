## Inspiration

We were inspired by the GPT-3 transformer and its breadth of knowledge. We knew that we could leverage that power into making an application that can provide value in the form of answers to assist patients and even healthcare professionals, worldwide.

## What it does

- Assist patients with healthcare-related queries.
- User authentication/authorization with firebase and react hooks.

## How we built it
- React 
- Vite
- Node
- Express
- Redux 
- Tailwind
- DaisyUI

## Challenges we ran into
- Connecting Firebase.
- Sharing State through the component hierarchy due to React's one-way binding.
- Making CSS Styling consistent and less hacky.
- Git merging and rebasing
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Finishing the app & having fun while doing it.
- Learning different aspects/quirks of react.
- Using OpenAl's API services for a good deed.
## What we learned
- UI Libraries make life easier, don't avoid them.
- Team synchronization takes work.
- React has issues, but still is the best tool for the job.
- Firebase/serverless is the future.

## What's next for The Al Doctor? 

- Considering the user's symptoms when generating a completion
- Persist data on the front end through a database
